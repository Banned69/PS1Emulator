### JS/WebGL/WebAudio based PLAYSTATION emulator (aka PSX, PS1)
*******

This emulator is being developed using **.h headers** in addition to **.js files**. It helps me keep the workspace clean and simple, while at the same time I can inline code for further optimization. In order to build it, just run the `build` command on the terminal. You must also include a valid **BIOS** file on the `bios` folder in order to test the emulator. I will not provide information on how and where to find that.

The whole code is compatible with **ES6 Javascript** onwards. Also, please use **Chrome** for best results (this is due to V8 optimization).

I have a slight case of OCD when it comes to software development, so excuse me if some parts seem a bit weird.
