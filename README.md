### JS/WebGL/WebAudio based PLAYSTATION emulator (aka PSX, PS1)
*******

This emulator is developed using **.h headers** in addition to **.js files**. It helps me keep the workspace clean and simple. In order to build it, just run the `build` command on the terminal. You must also include a valid BIOS file on the `bios` folder in order to test the emulator. I will not provide information on how and where to find that.

I have a slight case of OCD when it comes to software development, so pardon me if some parts seem a bit weird.
